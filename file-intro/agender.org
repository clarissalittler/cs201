* Agenda
 + Feels bad, man
 + Where have we come, where are we going
   + Does this count as stalling for time?
   + ...maybe
   + Future topics:
     + (async) Second rust video
     + Covering even more of network programming and writing servers
     + Part of a lecture will be optimization
     + Microkernel architectures (lecture + discussion)
       + Secure systems!
       + L4
       + seL4
     + RISCV architecture
     + (high level) lecture on the actual instruction set design
     + (if there are no requested deep dives) big review 
 + Opening files
   + The simplest way
   + Now let's handle errors (at least simply)
   + Command line arguments
   + Now again
   + We have the world's worst cat
 + Writing to files
   + Well, basically how we've already been doing writes
   + But now we need to write to (and possibly create) a file
   + Okay now we have a really bad version of copy
 + Reading directories
   + Listing everything that's in a directory
   + Listing everything that's a regular *file* in the directory
   + Now we make a silly little program that will present a menu of the regular files in a directory and let you select 1 to print
 + Now for networking and sockets!
 + Opening a socket and waiting for a connection
   + Connecting via nc
 + Now for an echo server
   + Again, talking to it over nc
 + Now for a tiny web server
   + This time let's use curl
 + ...probably save writing a client program until Tuesday?
