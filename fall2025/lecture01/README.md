# Lecture 01 - Introduction to C and Bit Manipulation

This lecture introduces C programming fundamentals and begins exploration of bit-level operations.

## Contents

- **firstC.c** - First C program example
- **bitmunger1.c** - Introduction to bit manipulation operations

## Compilation

```bash
# Build all examples
make

# Build individual programs
make firstC
make bitmunger1

# Clean up
make clean
```

## Running Examples

```bash
./firstC       # Run first C program
./bitmunger1   # Explore bit manipulation
```

## Key Topics

### C Basics
- Program structure (`main` function)
- Basic I/O with `printf`
- Compilation process

### Bit Manipulation
- Understanding binary representation
- Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
- Practical applications of bit operations
