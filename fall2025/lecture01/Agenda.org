 + The point of this class
   + What is "systems programming"
   + What is an operating system, really?
   + Learning C
   + Learning x86-64
   + Mechanics of this class
 + Writing C programs
   + slight differences
     + struct
     + no bool
   + bigger differences
     + printf
     + scanf
 + Bit-munging and the representation of numbers
 + 2's complement:
   for all bits 0 - 30
   b31 .. b1 b0

   $b_{31}*-2^{31} + \Sum_0^{30} b_{i} * 2^i$
 

   b_{31} * -2^{31} + b_{30} * 2^{30} + ...

   if I have n bits, what is the largest number that can be represented by those bits?

   111

   2^n - 1

   the largest number I can represent with the first 31 bits of the integer is
   2^{31} - 1
