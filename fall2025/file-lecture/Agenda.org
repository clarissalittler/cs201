* Agenda
** Files in Linux (with C)
** Everything Is a File
 + Directories are files
 + Devices are files
 + Terminal emulators are files
 + stdin/stdout
 + named pipes are files
   + may need to say what a pipe is
** File descriptors vs. FILE
 A "file" is just a really general abstraction to Unix/Linux and the kernel already has a big table of these that it managers that already includes alllll the machinery of permissions, reading, writing, opening, closing, &c.

 So why not reuse that as much as possible?

 A file descriptor is *just* an integer, which is the index into this table in the kernel. 
** Examples of opening, reading, writing, closing with FDs
** Taking arguments on the command line: argv/argc
** Write a fake cat
** FILE api and how to open/close and read/write to files
** simple linecounter
** Detour into parsing CSVs
** Directories and how to see what's in them
** fstat: the function that retrieves data about files
** Writing a simple version of ls
** Make a line editor together
