** Examples of function pointers
 Function pointers are how you accomplish "higher-order functions" in C and C++.

 What's a higher-order function?

 Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments.

 Tend to show up as an encapsulation feature like map/fold/reduce style functions or, in our case, when we're dealing with intializing threads.

 You pass to the thread start function the function that the thread should run.

*** Passing arguments to a thread
*** Returning data from a thread
** Causing race conditions
** Using a mutex to prevent them
** Passing a struct
** Parallel processing
