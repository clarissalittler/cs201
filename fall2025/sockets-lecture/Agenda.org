* Agenda
** Announcements
 + I moved the course repo to github
   + For technical reasons
   + https://github.com/clarissalittler/cs201
 + Final project directory is updated in the fall2025 folder
 + sockets tutorials are up
** How does a net work?
 + Networks layers and what they mean
   + I'm going to talk about the TCP/IP model of networks
     + Application
       + Things built on top of all the protocols that make the basic internet work
       + HTTP (Hypertext transfer protocol)
       + DNS
	 + How your computer gets the real address for a domain name
	 + This service needs to be reliable
	 + Needs to be secure
	 + It needs to be /fast/
	 + Basically a distributed cache for the mapping between domain names and IP addresses across the world
	   + Also needs to be super secure so people can't spoof domain names
       + Gopher
       + Gemini
       + The Onion Router (TOR)
       + Bittorrent
       + DAT
     + Transport
       + How is data broken into pieces and sent?
       + How do you guarantee data got to its destination?
       + What if you just don't care?
       + TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
	 + Makes sure every piece of data reaches its destination
	 + IN THE ORDER IT WAS SENT
       + UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
	 + maybe it gets there, maybe it don't
	 + maybe it's in the right order, don't maybe it
     + Internet
       + Routing
	 + How packets move around
	 + How does a packet get to the right place
       + Addresses
	 + IPv4
	   + 32 bit addresses
	     + 4 "octets" of a byte each
	 + IPv6
	   + 64 bit addresses
	   + Running out of addresses!
     + Network/Network access/Link
       + The physical connection of computer to internet
       + ethernet
       + wi-fi
 + Sockets
   + Internet sockets
     + Streaming
     + UDP
   + Network byte order
     + 0x123456
       + Little endian: 56 -> 34 -> 12
       + Big endian: 12 -> 34 -> 56
     + Network byte order is Big endian
   + 
 + Now we need to actually use sockets
** Baby's first echo server
 + (version with no error handling and only accepts *a* connection)
 + making a socket
   + surprise! it's a file 
 + setting up the address
   + the wooorst
 + binding a socket
   + int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
 + listening
   + int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
 + accepting
 + sending/receiving
 + closing a socket
** Connecting to it with netcat
** Connecting to it with a custom client
** Echo server, redone
** Using threads to make an even better echo server
** Sending a file
** Our first HTTP server (brief overview)
