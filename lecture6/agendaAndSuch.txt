Agenda:
1) brief review of posits (for homework sake)
2) review making a simple assembly program
3) review how we're putting data into status codes
4) cmp, the pony of a thousand tricks
5) if-statments in assembly
6) digression: labels and functions
7) faking funk(tions)
8) RIP %rip
9) push and pop, ret and call
10) back to the known^Wcase-statements
11) loops
12) ??? oh god I didn't expect us to get this far

POSITS:

two parameters:
# of bits
es - the max number of exponent bits

to interpret a posits number (8-bit, es=3, as an example) 

1 sign bit
up to 7 "regime" bits
if the number of regime bits is less than 7, up to 3 es bits
anything left over is a mantissa bit

if regime is all 1s
(-1)^s * 2^((#r -1)*2^es) 
       * 2^||e|| * (1 + ||m||)
if regime is all 0s
(-1)^s * 2^(-#r*2^es) 
       * 2^||e|| * (1 + ||m||)

to read a posit number:
 1. read the sign bit
 2. look at the first bit after the sign: if it is a 1, collect all 1s until you hit a 0 or the end of the bit-string. If it is a 0, collect all 0s until you hit a 1 or the end of the bit-string. count the number of bits you collect and call it #r
 3. skip the terminator of the regime bits, then collect up to es bits, interpret this as a unsigned number and that's the ||e||
4. if there are any bits left, interpret them as ||m|| a fractional binary number

01100111

(-1)^0 * 2^8 * 2^3 * (1 + 0.5)
= 2^8 * 2^3 * 1.5 = 2^11 * 1.5 = 3072

%rax =>

blah = funcall()

this is REALLY
mov %rax,(whatever the location of blah is)

int main(){
 int num1;
 scanf("%d",&num1);
 iseven(num1);
 return (iseven(num1));
}
