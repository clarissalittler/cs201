* Agenda
+ Starting threads!
+ What is a thread?
  + It's *sort of* its own process, but it shares the memory space of the parent
  + Effectively you have different threads of execution that all see the same scope of data
  + Much more efficient than forking in both time and space
  + *but* you pay for that for that efficiency with more complicated logic
+ Example 1: Start two threads
