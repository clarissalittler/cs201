** Forking and processes
 + Processes are capable of making other processes
 + fork()
 + but fork returns a /clone/ of the original and all of its registers including rip!
 + this means they're both going to move onto the next line
 + how do we know who the *real* process is?
 + we can check what fork returns!
   + if it's -1 then something went wrong
   + if it's a number > 0 then you're the parent and that's your baby's name
   + if it's a number == 0 then you're the baby, sorry
 + wait() lets you wait for your children to be done
   + you can pass it a pointer that will nab the data that the other process used to return!
   + WEXITSTATUS
     + returned = (returned >> 8) && 0xFF;
 + function pointers, because it's useful to know
 + [maybe] communication between processes with pipes!
** Signals and interrupts
 + What are interrupts and signals?
