* Agenda
** Reference
 To choose a syscall:
  + put the number of the syscall in %rax
  + *then* pass arguments like normal in the argument registers
 Argument order:
 + %rdi
 + %rsi
 + %rdx
 + %rcx
 + %r8
 + %r9
 Stack: 
 + current stack pointer %rsp
 + base pointer: %rbp
 Syscalls:
 + read = 0
   + Args:
   + fd
   + address
   + max size
 + write = 1
   + Args:
   + fd
   + address
   + bytes to write
 + exit = 60
 Caller saved:
  + rax
  + rcx
  + rdx
  + rsi
  + rdi
  + r8
  + r9
  + r10
  + r11
 Callee saved:
  + rbx
  + rbp
  + r12 - r15
** Syscalls for reading and writing bytes
 + Hello, World --- finally
   + make an output data buffer with the .rodata section
   + system call to write this to the screen
 + Echo program
   + Make an input buffer with .bss section
   + Read a series of bytes into the buffer
   + Note! This isn't going to be a null terminated string
   + read and write are too low level for that
   + The read syscall returned the number of bytes read
     + How was it returned?
     + In rax!
   + So we can use that in writing!
** Let's write a function that calculates the length of a null-terminated string
** Let's write a function that uses the stack
** Now lets write a function that will concatenate two null-terminated strings
