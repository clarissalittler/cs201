10010101 = 8 bits = 1 byte

1 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4
+ 0*2^5 + 0*2^6 + 1*2^7 = 1 + 4 + 16 + 128 = 149

9 & 12 = 8
 
1001 & 1100 =>

1   0   0   1

= 1000 = 8

1001 | 1100 = 1101 = 13

1001 ^ 1100 =>
1 0 0 1 msg

0 1 0 1

2's complement and how we represent signed integers

b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0

normally we think of this as:
2^0 * b0 + 2^1 * b1 + 2^2 * b2 + 2^3 * b3
+ 2^4 * b4 + 2^5 * b5 + 2^6 * b6 + 2^7 * b7

if I have n bits I can represent
0 -- (2^n - 1) with those n bits
orrrr
we can

2^0 * b0 + 2^1 * b1 + 2^2 * b2 + 2^3 * b3
+ 2^4 * b4 + 2^5 * b5 + 2^6 * b6 - 2^7 * b7
