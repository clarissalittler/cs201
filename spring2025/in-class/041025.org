* Why is bit shift multiplication or division?
  + Assume 8 bit numbers
  + 001101 = 13
    001101 << 1
    ==> 011010 = 2 + 8 + 16 = 26 = 2*13

  + 001101 = 13
    + two's complement:
      + first step: invert the bits
        + 110010
      + second step: add 1
        + 110011
    
* Registers
 + 16 of them on each core
 + Each one holds 64 bits (8 bytes) of data
 + They can be accessed in a single clock cycle
   + 1GHz processor has clock cycles of 1 billionth of a second
   + Hz = 1/s = s^-1
 + Are they like variables?
   + Sorta...but not really
   + They are the scratch paper of the processor
   + You write, erase, and rewrite on them constantly
   + Almost all operations are using the registers or else it would be too slow
 + What is a core?
   + A miserable pile of computation
   + The physical thing that runs code
   + Processors have *many* cores now
   + Each core has 16 * 8 = 128 bytes of fast storage
 + Speed comparison
   + How many variables do you need to saturate all the registers?
   + 16?
   + But it's worse than that, because anything you need to save to compute with later needs to be in a register at some point
   + memory is 10000s or 100000s of times slower
   + (caching helps with this, we'll talk about that)
