** What is this class?
** How does it work?
** C: A Brief Summary Thereof
 + You already almost know it
 + But there's some differences
 + Most them are subtractive
 + Main differences:
   + different libraries
   + no booleans
     + 1 and 0
   + structs always have to say struct
   + printf and scanf
   + gcc not g++
   + *only* char* no string
   + malloc and free not new and delete
   + No pass by reference!
     + ONLY POINTERS
** Bit munging
*** Bitwise operations
 + & bitwise and
 + | bitwise or
 + ^ bitwise xor
 + >> right shift
 + << left shift

 1 && 0 => 0 logical and
 1 || 0 => 1 logical or

  11100101
& 01110100
-----------
  01100100

     11100101
or | 01110100
-----------
     11110101

xor ^
1 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
0 ^ 0 = 0

  11100101
^ 01110100

  10010001

 n >> m
 shifts the bits in n over to the right m places
 leaving 0s in the left in its wake

 10000000 >> 1 => 01000000
 10000000 >> 3 => 00010000

 this effectively is a integer division by powers of 2

 n << m
 shifts the bits in n over to the left m places
 leaving 0s in the right in its wake

 00000001 << 1 => 00000010
 00000001 << 3 => 00001000

 multiplication by powers of 2
 
*** Experimenting with numbers 
** Integer representations
 for most bits!!! (except the last one)
 the nth bit adds b_n*2^n to the total

 2's complement

 (Assume an 8-bit 2's complement number for simplicity)
 10010101 ===>

 -1*2^7 + 0*2^6 + 0*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = -128 + 16 + 4 + 1 = -128 + 21 = -107 

 a 2's complement representation of signed numbers can represent

 -2^(n-1) -> 2^(n-1)-1

 unsigned for n bits
 2^n-1
 
** Next time: floating point numbers
